Core API
========

Boussole is mainly a commandeline tool but it relies on a core API that may be
used to implement another frontend.

This part of Boussole should not concern end users because they don't directly
exploit it, it documents some behaviors but they should be better documented from Tutorial.

The core API should be 100% covered for documentation and unittests.
